                Hi Fellow Creators,
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Weâ€™d like to first start of by saying thank you to everyone for being
                a part of the FimRxyz community. Unfortunately, after a long and
                exciting journey we have come to the end of the road. Over the next
                few days and weeks, FimRxyz will be going offline.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We are working on new and exciting projects. Our goal has been and will
                continue to be connecting creative people together so that they can
                create awesome things. It has been a great experience working on FimRxyz
                and we have learn a lot. We are very excited about what is to come and
                we look forward to working with everyone in the future.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
